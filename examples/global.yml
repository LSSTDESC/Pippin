# Note that these examples are for the specific task only, and you cannot run this file (as there are no dependent tasks).
# Use these files to see how you can configure your tasks, and the configs directory contains full analyses showing
# all the tasks and how they relate to each other

# You can also overwrite the global settings normally found in the cfg.yml file
# in your individual runs. Here is an example which reduces the number of jobs
# allowed in the queues and also adds another data path to look in when searching
# for your include / input files.
