CREATE_COV:
  ALL:  # Will match to all bias cor tasks
    MASK: something # masks on partial match to biascor name
    OPTS:
      COVOPTS:  # note you'll get an 'ALL' covopt no matter what
        - "[NOSYS] [=DEFAULT,=DEFAULT]"  # This refers to the default biascor sims

  SYSTEMATICS:
    OPTS:
      SYS_SCALE: $somewhere/sys_scale.list # Location of sys_scale.LIST file, relative to create_cov dir by default
      FITOPT_SCALES:  # Optional
        cal: 2.0  # checks if its in the label, not an exact match. So this would scale all *cal* fitopts by a factor of two
      MUOPT_SCALES: # Optional - used to construct SYSFILE input
        C11: 0.5 # This should exact match a MUOPT label in the biascor step. In this case, scales the C11 MUOPT by a half
      COVOPTS:  # note you'll get an 'ALL' covopt no matter what
        - "[NOSYS] [=DEFAULT,=DEFAULT]"
        - "[CALIBRATION] [+cal,=DEFAULT]"  # This gets passed directly in, not 100% sure how the syntax actually works...
        - "[SCATTER] [=DEFAULT,=C11]"  # The left hand side are FITOPT, right hand side is MUOPT
