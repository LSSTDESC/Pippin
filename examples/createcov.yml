        cal: 2.0  # checks if its in the label, not an exact match. So this would scale all *cal* fitopts by a factor of two
      MUOPT_SCALES: # Optional - used to construct SYSFILE input
        C11: 0.5 # This should exact match a MUOPT label in the biascor step. In this case, scales the C11 MUOPT by a half
      COVOPTS:  # note you'll get an 'ALL' covopt no matter what

        - "[SCATTER] [=DEFAULT,=C11]"  # The left hand side are FITOPT, right hand side is MUOPT
