BIASCOR:
  BCOR:
    BASE: surveys/des/bbc/bbc_5yr.input  # Base file to use, bbc.input is the default
    DATA: [DESFIT_DESSIM, LOWZFIT_LOWZSIM]  # The names of the lcfits_data/simulations going in. List format please.
    SIMFILE_BIASCOR: [DESFIT_DESBIASCOR, LOWZFIT_LOWZBIASCOR]  # The names of the biascor simulations. Will find the merged fitres output for it. Might have issues if more than one exists
    CLASSIFIER: UNITY  # The classifier to use. Should have a predict matching the data and biascor sims. Might have issues if more than one exists.
    MAKE_ALL_HUBBLE: False # Defaults to True. If True, makes one hubble diagram for each sim version (ranseed change). Else only makes the first hubble diagram. Good for when you generate 100 sims but dont want 100 plots clogging up the dir
    USE_RECALIBRATED: True # Defaults to False. Will load in the recalibrated probabilities, and crash and burn if they dont exist.
    CONSISTENT_SAMPLE: False # Defaults to True. If set to True, will rerun biascor twice, removing any SNID that got dropped in any FITOPT/MUOPT
  MUOPTS:
    DATA: [D_DESSIM, L_LOWZSIM]
    SIMFILE_BIASCOR: [D_DESBIASCOR, L_LOWZBIASCOR]
    CLASSIFIER: UNITY
    MUOPTS:  # A dict of muopt names and their biascor sims
      C11:
        SIMFILE_BIASCOR: [D_DESBIASSYS_C11, L_LOWZBIASSYS_C11]
        FITOPT: 0  # Which fitopt to use. Untested on non-zero numbers.
    OTPS:  # Batch info can be overriden in the generic opts
      BATCH_INFO: sbatch $SBATCH_TEMPLATES/SBATCH_Midway2_1hr.TEMPLATE 10
