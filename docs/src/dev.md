# Pippin Development

## Issues and Contributing to Pippin

Contributing to Pippin or raising issues is easy. Here are some ways you can do it, in order of preference:

1. Submit an [issue on Github](https://github.com/dessn/Pippin), and then submit a pull request to fix that issue.
2. Submit an [issue on Github](https://github.com/dessn/Pippin), and then wait until I have time to look at it. Hopefully thats quickly, but no guarantees.
3. Email me with a feature request

If you do want to contribute code, fantastic. [Please note that all code in Pippin is subject to the Black formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 
I would recommend installing this yourself because it's a great tool.
